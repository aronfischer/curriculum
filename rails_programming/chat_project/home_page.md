A great place to start when learning a big framework is how to serve static pages. The relative simplicity makes it ideal to start to learn the way Rails handles incoming requests from users of our app.

We need a place to house our static pages. All web pages live in the app/views directory. To keep our concerns separated we will create a directory in which to house them.

Inside `app/views` create a `static_pages` directory.

In the static_pages directory create our homepage. The file should be called `home.html.erb`.

How are we going to view this page?

The first point entry point into our application when an http request comes in is our routes file. This file tells Rails where incoming requests should be sent onto. The routes file is a configuration file and so unsurprisingly lives in the `config/` directory. Let's open it up and take a look.

#TODO Intro to routes

As we want the homepage to be the first page users see we can make it our root route.

In the routes.rb file lets add a route for our home page.

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root 'static_pages#home'
end
```

This tells our Rails app to take any requests to `/` and route them to our home method in a StaticPages controller.

We don't have that controller yet so let's create it now.

In the terminal type `rails generate controller StaticPages home`

This will create for us a StaticPages controller with the home method already written for us and a corresponding view in app/views/static_pages called home.html.erb. As this is generated by Rails they will add some default text for us. Fire up a Rails server and navigate to `localhost:3000`. Rails should route to the homepage and you should see some text on the screen.

#TODO Add screenshot of default homepage.

We don't want to distract from learning Rails so we'll keep the homepage as simple as possible. We installed Bulma and we can make use of their styles to create a good looking responsive page.

We want the homepage to offer a brief description of our project at this stage. We can always come back and update it as we add new features.

Delete the contents of home.html.erb and add the following

```html
<section>
  <div class="container">
    <h1 class="title has-text-centered">
      Odin Chat
    </h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Welcometh to odin chat.  Talketh 'mongst the gods of y're and beest m'rry</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

Refresh your homepage to see the new updated look. We will be adding some features to this as we go including a navbar and login and logout functionality but as things stand let's move on.
