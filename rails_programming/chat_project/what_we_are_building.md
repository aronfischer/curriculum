### Introduction

We'll be building a chat web application. This will not only teach you the basics of using Ruby on Rails but allow you to dive into more advanced topics such as WebSockets.

We will use the latest Ruby and Rails flavours which at the time of writing are:

* **Ruby**: 2.7.0
* **Rails**: 6.0.2.2

If you are on at least Ruby 2.6 and don't want to update to 2.7 that is fine but make sure you are on Rails version 6.
