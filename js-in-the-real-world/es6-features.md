I am hoping that we will not have to cover too much here.. Presumably many of the syntax things and features will be covered in earlier lessons.. however there are a few little details that need covered, including a section on transpilers.
things to cover include:
- Babel! (maybe we should write our own.. but this tutorial is pretty hip https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch)
- Destructuring
- Arrow Functions
- ??? probably something else I'm forgetting
- Probably don't need projects here.. students can just start working this stuff into their current work.   Might suggest students go back to a previous project and look for ways they could use these techniques
