Like we learned in the introduction lesson, Node.js is really just JavaScript.  So a basic understanding of JavaScript is necessary in order to understand Node. For this reason, it is highly recommended that you take our prerequisite [JavaScript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript) before continuing with this course. 

This lesson will take you through a tutorial that will teach you the basic modules and functions that you need to get up and running with Node.js. The project that comes right after this assignment will ask you to use Node to create a basic informational website with 3 pages, an index, about and contact-me. So be on the lookout for things that might help you do just that.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to do the following:

 - Explain the benefits of using Node.js.
