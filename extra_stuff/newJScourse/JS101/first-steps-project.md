this should be a simple-ish project that uses the things students should know at this point including:
1. variables
2. numbers/operators
3. strings
4. arrays (and array functions like forEach and map)

students will NOT know about functions or DOM interaction at this point, so the project should be suitably straightforward.

probably we'll roll something a lot like FCC's 'algorithm scripting' projects
just simple(ish) problems to solve.  Maybe 5-6 of them.

Could use a test-first repo, much like the ruby stuff, or could be in a repl.it project (need to research those)
