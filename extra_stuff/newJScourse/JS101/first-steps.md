The very first steps of learning any programming language are destined to be at least a little frustrating.  It's normal to feel lost and confused as you progress here, because no matter where you start in the material, there are definitely crucial elements of the language that you just have not been exposed to yet.  Having said that, we've _really_ tried to find the best materials to get you going as quickly and smoothly as possible. So embrace the cognitive dissonance, and let's go.

this lesson should cover the very beginning basics: 
1. variables
2. numbers/operators
3. strings
4. arrays

it is entirely possible that this lesson should be divided into multiple lessons.  Going to depend entirely on how long each section ends up being.

At this point I'm thinking the primary resource should be the MDN tutorials:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps

with reference to this document where appropriate: http://javascript.info/

should also show where to find documentation for each of the features as they're being taught (MDN again)
