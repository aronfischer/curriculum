The very first steps of learning any programming language are destined to be at least a little frustrating.  It's normal to feel lost and confused as you progress here, because no matter where you start in the material, there are definitely crucial elements of the language that you just have not been exposed to yet.  Having said that, we've _really_ tried to find the best materials to get you going as quickly and smoothly as possible. So embrace the cognitive dissonance, and let's go.

# remove this section
this lesson should cover the very beginning basics: 
1. variables
2. numbers/operators
3. strings
4. arrays

it is entirely possible that this lesson should be divided into multiple lessons.  Going to depend entirely on how long each section ends up being.

At this point I'm thinking the primary resource should be the MDN tutorials:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps

with reference to this document where appropriate: http://javascript.info/

should also show where to find documentation for each of the features as they're being taught (MDN again)

### Points to Ponder
* What is a variable, and how do you declare one in Javascript?
* Can you name all 3 ways to declare a variable in Javascript?
* What types of things can you store in a variable?
* What are the rules and guidelines for naming variables?
* What is 'Loose typing' and what does it mean for your code?
* How can you do math in Javascript?
* What is a string?
* What is an array?
* What types of things can you put into an array?


### Variables
You can think of variables simply as "storage containers" for data in your code.  Until recently there was only one way to declare and use a variable in Javascript (the `var` keyword) but the latest versions of Javascript include 2 more keywords that can be used depending on the situation. The following resources will tell you what you need to know!
1. Read through [this tutorial on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Variables). It only covers the first method of declaring a variable, but most of the information is relevant to the other methods as well. (Be sure to code along in your browser's console, or in the provided code boxes!)
2. Read through [this variable tutorial](http://javascript.info/variables) as well. It covers the other methods of variable creation.  __Be sure to do the Tasks__ at the end of this article!  Information won't stick without practice!
3. There is one quirk that you should be aware of when it comes to declaring variables.  In many cases you won't have to worry about this too much at all, but when it comes up it can definitely be a frustrating experience to debug if you don't already know about it.  Don't worry too much about it at this point, but read [this short article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var#var_hoisting) about variable hoisting, and keep it in the back of your mind for now.
