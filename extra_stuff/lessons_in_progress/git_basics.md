## The Basics of how to use git
In this lesson we will go over the basics of using Git in your projects. We will
cover the basics of using Git on your projects as well as uploading your projects
to Github.

## Learning Outcomes
*By the end of this you should be able to:*
* Create a Git repository on GitHub and move it onto your local machine
* Describe the difference between staging and committing changes
* Describe the difference between committing your changes and pushing them onto GitHub
* Check the status of your current repository from the command line
* Look at the history of your previous commits from the command line

## Assignment:
1. [Try Git from codeschool](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).
Follow the exercises up to and including "1.11 Pushing Remotely" then jump back here.
<!-- should we maybe add this? or is it too advanced -->
Optional to get an deeper understanding
2. Complete the first three sections of chapter 2 of Pro Git. [Getting a git repository](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository),
  [Recording changes to the repository](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository) and
  [Viewing the commit history](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Viewing-the-Commit-History)

<!-- maybe move this conclusion into the project instead? -->
## Conclusion
You may not feel completely comfortable with Git at this point, which is normal.
Git is a skill that you will only get more comfortable with as you use it. In the
project that comes after this lesson you will get a chance to practice using Git
as you would on a real project. Throughout Odin you will get plenty of opportunities
to practice using Git by using it with the various different projects you will be
assigned.

The main thing to take away from this lesson is the basic workflow, the commands
you have learnt here are the ones you will be using the most with Git. They will
soon be seared into your brain as you use them multiple times in your projects.
