#Gearing up for success

Before we get into the meat of the curriculum it would be beneficial to go over
the things that will help you succeed in your goal of learning to code and the
pitfalls that you should avoid.

## Mindset
Your mindset is very important when teaching yourself any new skills not just
programming, It has more of an impact of your chances of success than just about
anything else.

In this section we will look at getting clear about what your motivation for learning
programming is and getting yourself into the growth mindset so that you
will embrace challenges and struggles instead of getting overwhelmed and stressed.

###Your Motivation For Learning Programming
Getting clear about what your motivation or reasons for learning programming, is
extremely important. It will help pull you through to the end and give you a
definite goal to aim towards.

Your motivation to learn to code could be to have a fulfilling carer that pays
well, it could the creativity outlet programming provides, it may be to have the
skills and ability to build any sort of app you can think of, it might be to start
your own company by turning an app idea you have into reality. It may be a
combination of these reasons or something else entirely.

Whatever the reasons you have for learning to program you should take a moment to
think about it and get clear about what it is, It will be what pulls you through
to the end of this journey and gives you a definitive goal to aim towards.

To give your motivation a bit of a boost you can read about the success of others:

###The Growth Mindset
There is a wide body of research that supports that intelligence is not fixed,
it can be developed. People usually fall into one of the following two mindsets

**Fixed Mindset**
Someone who believes if they don't get something on their first attempt they never
will and that they aren't smart enough to do or get certain things.

**Growth Mindset**
Someone that believes they can get better at anything with effort and persistence.

What does this mean for you? it means you can learn new skills and develop new
talents with persistence and grit. There will be many times throughout Odin
that you will be stuck with a concept or a programming problem and may find
yourself questioning you ability to learn programming.

When you find yourself in this position, remind yourself that you may not get it
*yet* but with persistence and grit you will. Struggling with something is
growth, it doesn't matter how long you struggle with a concept or project all
that matters is that you have the grit and tenacity to see it through, thats how
real learning happens.

While you're working through the curriculum embrace the struggles you encounter
with learning difficult concepts and completing projects. And celebrate your
persistence at overcoming those struggles

Reflect on what you have done, when you find yourself questioning your ability
reflect on the successes you have had, the projects you have completed and the
concepts you at one time didn't understand but now do.

## The Best ways to Learn
Our curriculum has two fundamental aspects, you will have be assigned resources
to read, watch and do in a lesson. These are comprised of resources we have
gathered up from around the internet, the reason why we do this over rolling
our own material for everything is because this allows us to utilise the very best
resources that have been created by experts in their field that are authorities
in what they are teaching.

Most of these lessons are followed by projects that allow you to practice the
concepts you have just learnt about. Most of them will give you a description
of the problem you have to solve, this allows you to be as creative as you like
with the solution. You will learn by doing with Odin, the only way you can really
learn programming.

### The Process of Learning
The way we have structured out curriculum with lessons and projects is consistent
with the best ways of how to effectively learn. Learning involves understanding
concepts and practicing them to solidify your understanding by using the concepts
in a context where the concept is relevant.

When learning your mind will consistently switch between the following two states:

**Focus mode**
when you are actively focused on learning, reading, watching videos, working on
a project etc.

**Diffuse mode**
when you are not actively in a learning activity, doing the dishes, exercising,
sleeping etc. When in this state your mind goes about the business of connecting what
you have been learning to the other things you know. This is where break throughs
happen.

It's important to know that your mind goes through these two states to learn
because you can utilise these to make your learning more efficient. When stuck on
a concept or project taking a break to refresh and let your subconscious go to work
connecting what you are learning together more often than not leads to a solution
to your problem.

In short understand it, practice it, and finally teach it.

Teaching what you know to others is a great way to solidify what you have learnt
and can often reveal holes in your knowledge that you can improve on. You can use
our [slack chat](http://www.theodinproject.com/chat) to answer questions asked
by students who are not is far in  the course as you are to practice this method
of learning.

### What to do when you are stuck
You will inevitably be stuck at some point in the curriculum, it may be due to
a concept that you are having difficulty understanding or it may be due to
something not working when you are doing a project. What ever it is use this
following processes to get unstuck:

* Google it - you can be sure someone else out there has had the same problem as
you at some point, a quick google can often lead to a solution.
* Take a break - allow your diffuse state to work on the problem.
* Ask for help in our [chat](http://www.theodinproject.com/chat) - come prepared
with your research done, people will be more willing to help when they can see
have already put effort into trying the figure out the solution.

## Managing your Study Time
You will have more success with Odin by putting consistent time into it rather
than working on it every other day. Building a habit of studying everyday at
a specific time and for a specific amount of time will ensure you make consistent
progress.

### How to Avoid Procrastination
Procrastination will be your biggest enemy when trying to make progress, this how
to avoid it:

**Use the Pomodoro Technique**
The pomodoro technique is a way of managing your time in order to stay focused.
You basically set a timer for 25 minutes and work on a task until the timer goes
off. You then take a 5 minute break and go again for 25 once your break is over.

If you get distracted or interrupted during the 25 minutes you have to start the
25 minutes of work over again.

The pomodoro technique is great for avoiding procrastination as it forces you to
work without distractions and it's only for 25 minutes before taking a break
so it's not overwhelming.

To learn more about the pomodoro technique read this [great article](https://medium.com/skhack-life-2-0/multiply-your-productivity-with-pomodoro-eeac2645a78e#.clvcxxyk8)

**Avoid Digital Distractions**
digital distractions like email and Facebook notifications, time wasting websites
like social networks and reddit sap your focus, they should be avoided during
study time.

solution:
turn off notifications, add a blocker to your internet to limit time on time
wasting sites.

**Avoid Physical Distractions in your Environment**
Physical distractions are distractions from your environment, things like a TV in
the background, other people speaking etc.

solution:
Find a quiet study place in your home you can go to to focus, if that's not an
option you can use noise cancelling head phones to block out any noise distractions
from your environment.

- add this in somewhere https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard

Measure progress against yourself and dont compare yourself to others who are further along in thier learning journey or are seemingly picking things up easier. Reflect on how much you now know compared to how much you knew a week, month or year ago.
