<!-- Now the chatroom might be pretty inactive at a first glance but here are some things to keep in mind:
* Not everyone is in the same time zone as you!
* People have their own schedules and busy lives to take care of too.
* And not everyone is at the same level section or area as you in the learning curve.

Most people who frequent the chat are the ones that stuck around for their question to get answered. They also considered the interaction a great opportunity for learning and improving their code! -->

##How to get answers for your questions

###Asking your questions:
Try to really focus in on what the problem is. Break it down into little pieces and then decide what is really holding you back. [Rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) is a great way for doing this.

A good way to phrase your question is to tell us the context:
* What do you think the problem is?
* What do you want to happen?
* How did you get there?
* What have you tried so far?

###Formatting your questions:
Making your questions in a readable format helps us debug them better; here are some ways to go about that:

* In the chatroom, code can be displayed differently from normal sentences by using **backticks** - it's the button above your tab key - which are not to be confused with single quotation marks. If you wrap your code with backticks at both ends of the code you will get something like this: 

`#one backtick at both ends`

OR

```
#three backticks at the start
Your Code
#three backticks at the end
```

* Show us a **screenshot** if you can't pinpoint the problem - you should use this especially to show the output of commands in the command line
* **Push your code to github!** If the puzzle still can't be solved, push your project to github so others can comb through the code themselves.


##Maximise your learning with the community
<!-- Exposure is a great way of improving your scope - knowing that something exists or familiarity with the topic is half the battle. -->

<!-- Teach others! Memory retention is best aided by teaching others...  -->
<!-- RESOURCE -->

<!-- Share your work with people that can appreciate it! Use github for any codebase, rawgit if it's a webpage or heroku if it's an app. -->
