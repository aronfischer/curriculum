# Git 101
Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to take snap shots of the state of their projects over time. One of the problems it solves is having to make different versions of files for different changes. for example you may have done this with files in the past when making changes:

`cv-draft.doc`, `cv-experimental.doc`, `cv-final.doc`

with git you would simply make another separate branch where you can safely make changes. More on branches later.

Git will be the tool you will use to upload your portfolio of code to Github so that future potential employers can see what you can do when your looking for a development job.

On the topic of jobs, almost all software development companies will list Git as one of the required skills in their job specs.
All of this makes Git an essential skill for a modern web developer.  

 In this lesson we will briefly explore the history of Git, what it is and what it's useful for.

## Conclusion
You should now have high level understanding of what git is and what it's used for. Don't worry if Git doesn't make complete sense to you right now or if you're questioning why you would need to use it. In the next lesson we will go over the basic workflow of using Git on a small project, which should enhance your understanding and demonstrate why its so useful.
