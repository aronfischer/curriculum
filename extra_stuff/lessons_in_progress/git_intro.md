# Git 101
Git is like a really **epic save button** for your files and directories - officially git is called a version control system. <!--took out "distributed" as not a core part of understanding it for someone never exposed to VCS -->

To compare, a *save* in a text editor would record all of the words of a document as a single file. You are only ever given one record of the file like `essay.doc` unless you make duplicate copies (which would be difficult to remember to do and keep track of):

`essay-draft1.doc`, `essay-draft2.doc`, `essay-final.doc`

A *save* in git however, would record differences of files and folders AND keep a **historical record of each save**. This feature is a game changer. As an individual developer, git enables you to review how your project grows and to easily look at or restore file states from the past. Once connected to a network, git allows you to push your project to GitHub for sharing and collaborating with other developers.

While git works on your *local* machine, GitHub is a *remote* storage facility on the web for all your coding projects. This means that by learning git, you will get to showcase your portfolio on GitHub! This is really important because almost all software development companies consider the ability to use git as an **essential skill for a modern web developer** to have; having a portfolio will provide proof to future potential employers as to what you are capable of.

In this lesson we will briefly explore the history of Git, what it is and what it's useful for.

In the next lesson we will go over the basic workflow of using Git on a small project, which should enhance your understanding and demonstrate whygit is so useful. 


## Learning Outcome:
*By the end of this lesson you should be able to:*
* Define what kind of program git is
* Describe the differences between git and a text editor in terms of what they save and their record keeping
* Describe whether git and GitHub work at a local or remote level
* Describe why git is useful for an individual developer and a team of developers


<!-- Things to move to the next lesson -->
A *save* in git is divided into two terminal commands: **add** and **commit**. This gives you control of exactly what you want to be remembered in your snapshot. Think of `add` as adjusting the number of people or elements to be included in your photo, while `commit` is actually taking the photo, resulting in a snapshot.

with git you would simply make another separate branch where you can safely make changes. More on branches later.

## Assignment:
1. Read about [version control](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) and appreciate the differences between local, centralised and distributed version control systems. 
2. Now watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oRjP8yj2Wo) about how git can improve the workflow of an individual or a team of developers. <!-- What is VCS? (Git-SCM) â€¢ Git Basics #1  -->
3. Get some [context](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h9_cB9mPT8&feature=youtu.be&t=13s) of how git and GitHub came about. Make sure you know the difference between the two: note how git is referred to as a technology used in the *command line* while GitHub is a *website* you can [visit](https://github.com/)
4. Have a look at The Odin Project's very [own repository on GitHub](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum) - this is where all the lessons are stored! 
5. Finally, gain an appreciation of [how git records all collaborative efforts](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/graphs/contributors) and how GitHub visually represents this.


## Conclusion
<!--TO BE FILLED: The purpose of this lesson is to represent a high level overview of git - if it did then we don't need to mention the lesson was a high level overview; if it wasn't, then we need to rethink the lesson -->
