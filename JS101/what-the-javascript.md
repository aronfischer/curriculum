Perhaps we need a lesson describing what exactly JavaScript is, what it's used for, and why you need to learn it....

example: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript

not sure if that would be useful or not.



Maybe a bit here on what programming languages are and how they help us talk to computers?  
Wall of text, still in it's infancy:  https://github.com/jankeLearning/content-md/blob/master/programming-and-paradigms/02-programming-languages.md
