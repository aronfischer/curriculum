# Fundamentals 4

##Functions

Things are about to get _really_ exciting.  So far you have been writing an impressive amount of code to solve various problems but that code has not been as useful as it could be.  Imagine taking one of your scripts and bundling it into a little package that you could use over and over again without having to rewrite or change the code.  That's the power of functions and they're used _constantly_ in JavaScript.

1. [Another lengthy MDN article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Functions) is a good place to start.  Pay special attention to the sections on 'Function Scope'.  Scope is one topic that commonly trips up both beginner and intermediate coders so it pays to spend some time with it up front.  
2. Read this article about [return values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Return_values).  
3. Next, read [this one](http://javascript.info/function-basics) from Javascript.info.  We've mentioned this before, but JavaScript has changed a bit over the years and functions have recently recieved some innovation.  This article covers one of the more useful new abilities: 'default parameters'. \(and don't forget the 'tasks' at the end!!\)  
4. Finally, read [one more article](http://javascript.info/function-expressions-arrows) about functions in Javascript that will give you a little more context.  Another relatively new feature in modern JavaScript is the `arrow function`. Which is introduced in this article.  Arrow functions are useful, but not incredibly crucial so don't worry about them too much just yet.  We include them here because you are likely to encounter them as you move forward, and it's better that you have at least _some_ idea of what you're looking at whenever they crop up.

##  Practice

Should require setting up on your own machine.
