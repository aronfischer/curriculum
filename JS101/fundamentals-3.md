For the last leg of our tour of the basics of JavaScript we're going to learn about Objects and a more in-depth look at some useful things you can do with arrays.

### Objects101

Objects are a _very_ important part of the JavaScript language, and while for the most part you can accomplish simple and even intermediate tasks without worrying about them, any real project that you're going to attempt is going to feature Objects.  The uses of Objects in JavaScript can get deep relatively quickly, so for the moment we're only going to cover the basics.  There'll be an in-depth dive later.

1. Read [this introduction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics) to Objects on MDN.
2. Read [this description](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_JS) of Object Oriented Programming \(OOP\) in Javascript.  This article just barely scratches the surface of something we'll dig into more later.
3. This time the Javascript.info article covers quite a bit of useful information that the MDN article doesn't get to.  [Check it out](http://javascript.info/object) \(and do the Tasks!\)

### Intermediate/Advanced Array Magic

Besides being a quick and handy way to store data, arrays also have a set of functions for manipulating that data in very powerful ways.  Once you begin to master these functions you will start to see ways to use them all over the place! There are really only a handful of these functions... but as you'll soon see the possibilities of what you can do with them are near endless.

1. Start out by watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB1ZC7czKRs) from Wes Bos.  If you sign up for his course \(it's free!\) you can download the code and follow along.
2. Watch and code with [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNmRfyNg1lw) of Wes Bos's array series.
