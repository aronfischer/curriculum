Welcome to The Odin Project's JavaScript 101 course! This course represents a complete rewrite of our existing beginning JavaScript curriculum.  At first glance it seems quite a bit longer than our existing content, but only because we wanted to make sure that our students _really_ grasped the material that we present.  We've broken the individual topics up into multiple smaller lessons and added more practice projects into the mix so by the time you finish it you will have an amazingly strong foundation for the rest of your webdev career, whether that is continuing on with JS or just using it alongside other frameworks like Ruby on Rails

# How this course will work

We have completely removed much of our original content and base most of our fundamentals work around two great sites, [https://developer.mozilla.org/](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) and [javascript.info. ](http://javascript.info/) We start by hitting the fundamentals in 3 separate lessons, while interspersing other important lessons that you will need.  This 101 course is intended to be taken sequentially, and _most_ of the lessons and projects build on each other.

Each lesson will begin with a **points to ponder** section which will give you a good idea of the content and will allow you to quiz yourself after finishing the lessons.

The lessons will include readings, tutorials, videos and small projects.  Every few lessons there'll be a larger project to tackle that will try to combine the things you've learned up to that point.  Ideally by the end you will have learned quite a lot, and had _many_ chances to put it all to practice.  Be sure that as you go through the lessons you are actually typing any code into an editor yourself!  You won't learn much by copy and pasting!

# Prerequisites

If this JS curriculum is your first look at Odin, you should know that it is intended as a piece of a larger set of web-development lessons. As such, there are a few things that we are assuming you know about here. Before diving in, scan through the contents of [this course](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101) on Odin. This content will eventually sit in the place of the current JavaScript and jQuery lessons that exist about halfway down the page.The following is a short list of items that we're expecting you to know at least something about.

1. [Command Line Basics](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/command-line-basics)
2. Git [Intro](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/introduction-to-git) and [Basics](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/git-basics)
3. [HTML/CSS Basics](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-and-css-basics)
4. [Developer Tools](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/developer-tools)

If you're impatient you'll _probably_ be OK without going through Odin's WebDev101 course before jumping in to this course, but I'd recommend taking a day or two and going through each lesson and project up through the HTML/CSS project.
