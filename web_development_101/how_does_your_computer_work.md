# Command Line Basics
<!-- *Estimated Time: 3-6 hrs* -->

<!-- Purpose of lesson: to teach the student the basics of the command line, ie navigating, creating and deleteing files and      directories.
     This lesson could use some focus, it's tring to do too much too soon, it should focus on its pupose with a few good          resources. A full blown command line course would be awesome.
     This should also be renamed to command line basics -->

## The Command Line isn't as Scary as you Think 

Raise your hand if you're scared of the command line.  Yes, we have this image of developers staring at a black screen with white or green text flashing across while they wildly enter incomprehensible commands and hack into the corporate mainframe (spilling soda and wiping cheetos off their keyboard no doubt as well).

That black screen (or window) is the command line, where you're able to enter commands that your computer will run for you.  And while that image of a programmer is a bit overdone, the command line really is sort of like our base of operations, from which we'll launch other programs to do our "real developing" in.  It has a syntax of its own which is different but not all that difficult to pick up.  You'll be entering the same commands dozens of times anyway, so you'll get pretty good at it in a short period of time.

## Points to Ponder

*Look through these now and then use them to test yourself after doing the assignment*


* What is the command line?
* How do you open it on your computer?
* How can you navigate into a particular file directory?
* How can you create a directory?
* How can you destroy a directory or file?
* How can you rename a directory or file?

## Assignment:

*Note: Many of these assume you're using a Mac or a Linux environment. You can skip a head to the installations section and follow the instructions to install linuc or use a online ide like [cloud 9](https://c9.io/) or [Nitrous.io](https://www.nitrous.io/) They have a terminal window you can practice with.*

1. To get a initial high level overview of the command line, check out [A Command Line Crash Course](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/web-development-basics/a-command-line-crash-course) from the Viking Code School Prep Work.
2. Complete the first 2 sections of this interactive codecademy course to get a great handle on the navigating and manipulating directories and files [command line course](https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/learn-the-command-line).
3. Finally Go through Chapter 1 of [Conquering the Command Line](http://conqueringthecommandline.com/book/basics)

## Additional Resources

*This section contains helpful links to other content. It isn't required, so consider it supplemental for if you need to dive deeper into something*
* To dig a little deeper, take this [Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/) by Zed Shaw.  It can be a bit rough at times because the explanations are a bit sparse.
* If you want to deconstruct a particularly strange shell command or learn how Bash works through guess-and-check, [ExplainShell.com](http://explainshell.com/) is your solution.
