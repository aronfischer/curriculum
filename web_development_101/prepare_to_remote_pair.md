# Preparing to Pair
<!-- *Estimated Time: .5 hrs* -->

As you learned in the last lesson, pairing in person is the best option, but if that isn't a viable solution, we have many options for pairing remotely. To get underway, you will need a way to share a screen and a way to communicate:
* Screen Sharing Options. There may be more, but these are a few of the most popular:
  * [Screenhero](https://screenhero.com/) is a popular option, but as of December 2016 it is not open to new accounts while they are integrating with [Slack](https://slack.com/) but if you both already have Screenhero accounts, by all means use it.
  * If you both are using Macs, you can use its [built in screen sharing app](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18686).  
  * For Atom users, there is [Motepair](https://atom.io/packages/motepair) but we found it challenging to set up and configure.
  * The Odin Project currently recommends [cloud 9](https://c9.io). It's free, doesn't need to be installed, and it is easy to share your screen.
* Communication Options. You can always text chat, but for true Pair Programming, you will need voice communication. The Odin Project does not have a preference, just find one that works for you and your partner:
  * [Screenhero](https://screenhero.com/) has its own built in voice chat, but as mentioned above, unless you already have an account you are currently out of luck.
  * Microsoft's [Skype](https://www.skype.com/) is probably the most well known.
  * The other primary option is [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/).
