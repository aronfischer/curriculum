[jQuery](http://skillcrush.com/2012/07/23/jquery/) is a library of commonly used javascript widgets and functions that has more or less taken the internet by storm.  It's written in javascript and it means that you don't have to go through the pain of building a popup modal dialog box or a dropdown menu, for example, the long way.  It also gives you the incredibly easy ability to select elements on the webpage ("DOM elements") so you can start modifying their properties, whether that's hiding them, moving them, changing their contents... it's all in your hands!

jQuery will let you take your javascript knowledge and start really diving into your webpages and messing with (ahem, improving) the elements.

### Points to Ponder

*Look through these now and then use them to test yourself after doing the assignment*

* What is the DOM?
* How can you interact with the DOM?
* How can you add elements to the DOM?
* How can you modify the contents of an element?

### Assignment:
1. Learn about jQuery by doing [Codecademy's jQuery Track sections 1-3](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery) ("Introducing jQuery", jQuery Functions", and "Dynamic HTML"). *NOTE* As of August 2017 this course was removed while they are working on a new course to be released in September 2017. You can read about it in a blog post [here](https://www.codecademy.com/blog/important-changes-to-codecademy-courses?utm_campaign=composer_course_replacement&utm_medium=int_butterbar_course_page&utm_source=codecademy_platform).
2. If you can't get enough, also give [Code School's try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/) a shot (let us know which is better!).
3. The remaining Codecademy sections are, again, extra credit and will be covered later in the curriculum.
