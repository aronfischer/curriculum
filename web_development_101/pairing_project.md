# Project: Paired Pomodoro Project
<!-- *Estimated Time: 4-8 hrs* -->

Now you know what pair programming is and how to set up your computer for it. Hopefully you've found yourself somone to pair with because we are about to build something that will be much easier with two heads.

*If you are unable to find someone to pair with, or don't wish to pair program, don't worry. Just make sure you are comfortable with the concepts in the last two lessons, mark this complete, and go on to the next section.*

[The Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a time management system where you work for a period of time then take a short break, then work for a period of time then take a short break, and so on. This is also a useful system for switching between Driver and Navigator roles when pairing.

We are going to make a Pomodoro clock similar to [this](https://arcane-ravine-59782.herokuapp.com/) which will count down twenty-five minutes of work, indicate it is break time, count down five minutes, then start over again. If you've been following along the curriculum, you should have most of the tools you will need to make it. But if you do have problems, there are two of you! Put your minds together and figure it out.


## Before Starting

These skills will be helpful for you when you start building:

1. If you haven't already, make sure to do the [git lessons](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/introduction-to-git). While you are working on the project, it can live on the shared Cloud 9 workspace, but once you are done, you'll want to have a place to put it for both of you.
2. Don't forget that you can use the documentation websites for any of the languages that you chose to use. And feel free to pick each others brains.


## Student Solutions

* Add your solution below this line! Don't forget to include both you and your pair's names in the solution!

## What Next?

Congratulations! You and your partner have created something together, and you have practiced a very common development method in the process. By all means continue to pair on the rest of the projects in the curriculum. You will find that you learn more by bouncing ideas off each other and teaching one another than you would on your own. And remember, you don't have to stick to the same partner for the whole program! you can always feel free to go back to the [Pairing Room](https://gitter.im/TheOdinProject/LookingForPairs) to find someone new.
