# How Does the Web Work?
<!-- *Estimated Time: 1-2 hrs* -->
<!-- update: Web Developer Tools moved to new lesson. -->

Before you can understand how to *program* the web, you need to understand the web itself on a more granular level than you probably do now.  Some of this stuff is necessary just to have a more wholistic understanding of the ecosystem in which you will be working (and to not sound like a total newbie when talking to other developers about it), but other aspects (like HTTP) will come up again and again when you start programming.
  
## Learning Outcomes
*At the end of this lesson you should be able to:*

* Describe what the 'internet' is
* Describe what 'packets' are and how they are used to transfer data
* Understand the differences between a 'webpage', 'web server', 'web browser' and 'search engine'
* Briefly explain what a 'client' is
* Briefly explain what a 'server' is
* Explain what 'DNS servers' are
* Explain, in your own words, what happens when you click "search" on google.com
