# How Does the Web Work?
<!-- *Estimated Time: 1-2 hrs* -->
<!-- update: Web Developer Tools moved to new lesson. -->

Before you can understand how to *program* the web, you need to understand the web itself on a more granular level than you probably do now.  Some of this stuff is necessary just to have a more wholistic understanding of the ecosystem in which you will be working (and to not sound like a total newbie when talking to other developers about it), but other aspects (like HTTP) will come up again and again when you start programming.
  
## Points to Ponder
*Look through these now and then use them to test yourself after doing the assignment*

* What is the internet?
* How is information broken down and sent?
* What are packets?
* What is a "client"?
* What is a "server"?
* What are DNS servers?
* What happens when you click "search" on google.com?

## Assignment:
1. For a basic and painless Internet overview, check out [Don't Fear The Internet's Simple Primer (video)](http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com/01-not-tubes/). *Note: Sorry if it is redirecting to spammy sites, they have been hacked before*
2. Check out [How Does the Internet Work? (video)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj7A2YDgIWE) for a basic explanation of how packets work.
