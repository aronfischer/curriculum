# Git Branches Introduction
This lesson is focused on one of the key features of Git: branches. Branches allow developers to create a fresh copy of their software repository and experiment. Branches can be useful for testing new ideas, compartmentalizing projects, and allowing multiple developers to contribute to the same project simultaneously.
