# Project: Git Remotes

In this project we will be forking TheOdinProject curriculum and learning to add your name and a link to your profile on GitHub through a pull request. This is a common way to contribute to open source software on GitHub and valuable skill. Your pull request will be reviewed by the team at TheOdinProject and once approved it will appear on TheOdinProject/Curriculum and be used to create an honor roll.

## Learning Outcomes
*By the end of this project you should be able to:*
* Fork an existing repository from GitHub and download it to you local machine.
* Add an additional remote to git so you can update your fork to include any changes from the original repository after it is forked.
* Create a new branch, make changes and push your updates to the forked repository.
* Create a pull request on GitHub to the administrators of the repository so it can be merged into the original code.
* Feel comfortable with the process outlined below and be able to contribute to open source projects with pull requests of bug fixes or documentation improvements as you move through TheOdinProject.

## Your Task
1. Go to [TheOdinProject'scurriculum GitHub](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum)  repository. The files within this repository make up the lessons within [TheOdinProject](http://www.theodinproject.com/) and fork the repository by clicking the button shown below.

2. After a short wait you should now have your own fork of the GitHub repository at `https://github.com/Your-GitHub-UserName/curriculum`. You now have a copy of the curriculum and are free to make changes to it and take it in a different direction or add your own features.
3. However, for our project we will keep our fork the same and create a branch that is only different in the `git/student_list.md` file by adding your name and a link to your GitHub repository. In terminal cd into the folder where you would like to place your forked copy of the curriculum and clone it with this line `git clone https://github.com/odin-student/curriculum.git`
