# Project: Git Remotes

In this project we will be forking TheOdinProject curriculum and learning to add your name and a link to your profile on GitHub through a pull request. This is a common way to contribute to open source software on GitHub and valuable skill. Your pull request will be reviewed by the team at TheOdinProject and once approved it will appear on TheOdinProject/Curriculum and be used to create an honor roll.

## Your Task
*By the end of this project you should be able to:*
* Fork and existing repository from GitHub and download it to you local machine.
* Add an additional remote to git so you can update your fork to include any changes from the original repository after it is forked.
* Create a new branch, make changes and push your updates to the forked repository.
* Create a pull request on GitHub to the administrators of the repository so it can be merged into the original code.
* Feel comfortable to be able to contribute to open source projects with pull commits of bug fixes or documentation improvements as you move through TheOdinProject
