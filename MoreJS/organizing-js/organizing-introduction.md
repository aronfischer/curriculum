# Organizing your JavaScript code

One of the most daunting parts of JavaScript is learning how to organize your code properly.  The reason this subject can be so overwhelming is _not_ because JavaScript is so much more complex than other languages, but because it is incredibly forgiving!  

Many languages force you into using specific patterns and data structures in your code but JavaScript more or less lets you do what you want.  In the beginning this is a great thing!  For example, if you just want to make a simple button on your webpage do something you can set that up in a couple lines of code.

As you have probably experienced, once you move beyond simply manipulating a button or two, things can get hard to maintain unless you take care to organize your code in some way.  However, because JavaScript is such a flexible language exactly how you do that is entirely up to you, and because of __that__ there are an exceedingly large number of ways to do it.  

This lesson series is going to cover a few of the most common design patterns that occur in modern JavaScript code, will discuss some of the pros and cons of each pattern and will give you a chance to practice using each pattern in a project. 

The patterns we'll be covering in this series are:

- Plain Old JavaScript Objects and Object Constructors
- Factory Functions
- Module Pattern
- Classes
- ES6 Modules

Going through these will also give us a chance to learn about a few other important concepts in JavaScript such as "closure", "prototypes", "IFEEs" and more!  This series covers the most important parts of JavaScript after simply learning the basics of the language... are you ready?
