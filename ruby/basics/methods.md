# Methods
Methods, also known as functions, are one of the foundational building blocks in programming.
Almost every language implements some way of making methods.

You will often find yourself writing the same code in different places in your code.
Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to reuse the same code over and over again 
without having to write it all out again? 

This is what methods are for. They allow you to wrap code in a name which you
can then use where you need that code to be run in your programs.

In this lesson we are going to deconstruct what methods are, their behaviour, and how they are used.

## Learning outcomes
*Look through these now and then use them to test yourself after doing the assignment*

* You understand how to use Rubys built in methods on objects
* You know how to create your own custom methods
* You know how to *call* your own methods
* You understand the difference between a explicit and implicit return in your methods
* You 

* Understand the difference between `puts` and `return`


## Assignment
1. To get a good introduction to all the different concepts related to methods read [this chapter about methods](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/methods) from Launch Schools Introduction to Programming with Ruby book. Make sure to do the exercises at the end of the chapter too.
2. For a deeper look at methods read [this chapter](http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/methods/) from the Bastards book of Ruby.
