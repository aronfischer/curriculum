# Arrays
At the beginning of this section, you learned about creating and manipulating individual instances of number and string objects. In real-world development, where you'll be working with dozens (and even hundreds!) of such objects and variables, working with individual instances will be tedious, if not impossible.

One way Ruby allows you to represent a collection of such objects is with the use of **arrays**. Rather than working on individual objects at a time, an array allows you to create and manipulate an ordered and indexed collection of such objects (known as **elements** within the array) as a list. An array can contain any combination of Ruby objects (including other arrays), though it is advised that you keep similar objects in any one array.

## Learning outcomes
*Look through these now and then use them to test yourself after doing the assignment*

* The student understands what an array is
* The student knows how to create an array
* The student knows how to access data in an array
* The student knows the different methods for adding data to an array
* The student knows the different methods for removing data from an array
* The student knows the different methods for iterating through an array

## Assignment
* Read [Beginning Ruby](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beginning-Ruby-Professional-Peter-Cooper/dp/1484212797/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1475608118&sr=8-1&keywords=beginning+ruby) Chapter 3: "Ruby's Building Blocks: Data, Expressions, and Flow Control", focusing on pages 47-52 (third ed.) titled "Arrays and Lists" for a preliminary treatment on what arrays can do.
* Follow along this [article](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/arrays#whatisanarray) by Launch School, and go through the exercises using IRB or any other REPL, such as [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/ruby).

## Exercises
A group of exercises (If Applicable) for the student to complete in relation to the topic taught in the lesson.

## Additional Resources
* Look over the latest Ruby API documentation on Arrays [here](http://ruby-doc.org/) by clicking on "Core" and searching for "Array". There, you'll find the most up-to-date documentation on the various methods available to the Array object, along with explanations.

Link to no more than three additional resources to avoid this section becoming too cluttered.
