# Basic Enumerable Methods
* what enumerable methods are
* some can be used on hashes, others turn a hash into an array

## Learning outcomes
*Look through these now and then use them to test yourself after doing the assignment*

* What are `enumerables`?

* What does the `each` method do?
* What does the `each_with_index` method do?
* How are they different?

* When should you use `do...end` around a code block versus `{...}`?

* What does the `count` method do?
* What does the `sort` method do?

* Why is there a question mark after some methods?
* What does the `include?` method do?
* What does the `any?` method do? The `all?` method? `none?`?


* What does the `select` method do?
* What does the `find` method do?
* How is the `find_all` method different from `find`?

* What does the `map` method do?
* What is an alias for the `map` method?

* What does the `reduce` method do?
* What is an alias for the `reduce` method?

* link to ruby doc for complete list of all enumerable methods
* Less commonly used methods:
* `group_by`
* `grep`

A group of exercises (If Applicable) for the student to complete in relation to the topic taught in the lesson.

## Additional Resources
*This section contains helpful links to other content. It isn't required, so consider it supplemental for if you need to dive deeper into something*

Link to no more than three additional resources to avoid this section becoming too cluttered.

Link to Ruby docs for all enumerable methods to see that there are many more though they are used less often. Name a few here.
