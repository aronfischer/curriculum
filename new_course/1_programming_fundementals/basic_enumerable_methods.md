### Introduction

The Enumerable module is a set of methods which can be included in Ruby classes (like Array and Hash).
You can even include it in your own classes, which will be covered later on. These methods are handy
for looping through objects in a collection (most commonly arrays, hashes, and ranges). They provide
easy ways to perform common actions, and are among the most important tools for Rubyists. Some enumerable methods can be used on hashes just as on arrays, while others are implemented differently depending on
the type of collection used.

## Learning outcomes
*Look through these now and then use them to test yourself after doing the assignment*

* What are `enumerable` methods?

* What does the `each` method do?
* What does `each` return?
* What does the `each_with_index` method do?
* How are they different?

* When should you use `do...end` around a code block versus `{...}`?

* What does the `count` method do?
* What does the `sort` method do?

* Why is there a question mark after some methods?
* What does the `include?` method do?
* What does the `any?` method do? The `all?` method? `none?`?


* What does the `select` method do?
* What does the `find` method do?
* How is the `find_all` method different from `find`?

* What does the `map` method do?
* Does `map` modify the calling object?
* What is an alias for the `map` method?

* What does the `reduce` method do?
* What is an alias for the `reduce` method?

* How do you check if every item in a hash fulfills a certain criteria?

* link to ruby doc for complete list of all enumerable methods
* Less commonly used methods:
* `group_by`
* `grep`

## Exercises
A group of exercises (If Applicable) for the student to complete in relation to the topic taught in the lesson.

## Additional Resources
*This section contains helpful links to other content. It isn't required, so consider it supplemental for if you need to dive deeper into something*

Link to no more than three additional resources to avoid this section becoming too cluttered.

* There are many more enumerable methods than are covered here (`reject`, `drop`, `uniq`, to name a few) For a full listing, check out the Ruby Docs:
